# Airplane Bird Strikes - Data Science Challenge  
Data Science Challenge to predict airplane bird strike risk using logistic regression   
## Task based on a hypothetical scenario: Analysis of Airline incidents caused by birds 
As a Data Science consultant working for "Network Airlines", you have been asked to help the team with the analysis of the incident data. The dataset contains records of aircraft incidents caused by wild birds. 

Your task is to explain the data selection and analysis approach you have taken in the process of developing a machine learning model to predict a collision ("INDICATED_DAMAGE" column) using either logistic or linear regression. The selection of the regression and attributes is yours.

We would like to know the accuracy results of your model, preferably through a confusion matrix you have generated from your model, and how it can be used to avoid future incidents for the airline.

The best way to report your results is by a short presentation of 2-3 slides including key graphs and recommendations. 

You will then present your findings to the Safety Committee of the Airline and the technical team who will be ALSO assessing your notebook. 

You have 3 days to complete the task.

## Tips for you 
- No deep learning is required for the completion of this task.
- You can use any python libraries you like.
- There is no single correct solution.
- Hopefully it shouldn't take too long to complete the task but if it becomes an issue, please let us know. 

## Submission Instructions 
- Please submit your notebook and any other files you have created as part of your analysis.
1. Python Notebook file (`*.ipynb`) with the code used to develop the model and the analysis task.
2. Python (>=3.6) Requirements file (`requirements.txt`) so that we can replicate your notebook runs. (you can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate this file) 
3. PowerPoint/other presentation (`*.pdf`). 

## Data 
You will only work with a single CSV file (`strike_reports.csv`) and the accompanying metadata description (`column_description.csv`).

[The data is to big for GitHub and can be found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZpUuzTmm2nEfg60e9UlbiKS5EDf9RpU/view?usp=sharing)   

## Questions?

Please let us know if you need any further clarification.

## The Repo Contents are my answer to the challenge from early 2022  
There is a pdf of slides that were used to present the results and a Jupyter notebook showing how I got the results.
